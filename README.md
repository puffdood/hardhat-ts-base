# Hardhat Project with TypeScript

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case using typescript. It comes with a sample contract and a test for that contract. It is configured to work with `hardhat-deploy` plugin for intuitive contract deployment. And, `hardhat-etherscan` for contract verification. Beyond those the project also comes with example script and tasks.
